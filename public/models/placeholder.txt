Face detection models should be placed in this directory.
In a production application, you would include the following files from face-api.js:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
